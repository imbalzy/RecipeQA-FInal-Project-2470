The idea was to give him 20 spices, and a rack to hold them. We bought 20 spice jars with caps and shaker inserts from Specialty Bottle.Once they arrived, it was time to get busy.

For the bottom material I used some 1/8\\\" Luan, again a scrap piece. The sides are 1/4\\\" plywood. (yes, from the scrap bin)Using the table saw, I cut an 1/8\\\" notch, about 1/8\\\" up the side of 1/4\\\" plywood sides. I ran this cut all the way through, yes it leaves a gap that's visible.
